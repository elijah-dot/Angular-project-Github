  <h1>why is it important?</h1>
  <p>
    Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes
    you make to files, so you have a record of what has <br> been done, and you can
    revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes
    collaboration easier, <br> allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged
    into one source.
